Given the following SPICE netlist of a differential amplifier, identify 3 components that can be deleted without significantly compromising the functionality of the circuit.

For each component you identify, provide a short explanation (1-2 sentences) describing why removing it would have minimal impact and any caveats or dependencies to be aware of.

Return the answer as a JSON array of objects with keys: 'component', 'reason', 'impact_estimate'.
